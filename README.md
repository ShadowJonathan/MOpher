# MOpher API, a golang API for minecraft

### Current protocol:
**316 (minecraft 16w50a/1.11.1/1.112)**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShadowJonathan/MOpher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShadowJonathan/MOpher) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ShadowJonathan/MOpher)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ShadowJonathan/MOpher)

The MOpher API is growing to be a minecraft API for golang bots, the current project is growing to be an self-sufficient, scriptable bot, but it's also intended to extend it into an importable API.

**This API is still heavily in development and growing, it would be appriciated if you can help out a hand by posting a pull request or submitting an issue**

Protocol definitions originate from [the minecraft protocol wiki](http://wiki.vg/Protocol), and most of the code has been written and inspired from [Thinkofname's minecraft client](https://github.com/Thinkofname/steven-go), with many changes and additions.
